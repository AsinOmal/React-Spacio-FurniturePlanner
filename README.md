## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **npm** ≥ 9

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AsinOmal/React-Spacio-FurniturePlanner.git
cd React-Spacio-FurniturePlanner

# 2. Install Frontend dependencies
npm install

# 3. Install Backend dependencies
cd server
npm install

# 4. Configure Backend Environment
# Create a .env file in the `server` directory with the following:
PORT=5005
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/spacio
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key

# 5. Start the Backend server (in the server/ directory)
npm run dev

# 6. Open a new terminal window in the project root and start the Frontend
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:5173**

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

To run the entire MERN stack (MongoDB, Node Backend, Nginx Frontend) in an isolated containerized environment:

```bash
# Ensure Docker is running, then execute:
docker compose up --build -d
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost**

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized output will be in the `dist/` directory. Serve it with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Spacio includes a full suite of automated unit and integration tests.

### Frontend Unit Tests (Vitest)
Tests coordinate boundary logic (`clampToRoom`), colour shade utilities, and `DesignContext` state management using a mocked backend.

```bash
# Run all frontend tests
npm run test

# Run tests once with a summary output
npm run test:run
```

### Backend API Tests (Supertest)
Integration tests for the Express API endpoints backed by `mongodb-memory-server` to ensure route logic and JWT authentication work correctly without needing a real database running.

```bash
cd server
npm run test
```

## 🔑 Demo Credentials

| Username | Password |
|---|---|
| `designer` | `furniture123` |

> **Tip:** You can also click **"Continue as Guest (Demo Mode)"** on the login modal to skip authentication entirely and jump straight into the editor.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Y` or `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z` | Redo |
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | Remove selected furniture item |
| `Ctrl + Scroll` | Zoom in / out on the canvas |

---

## 🎨 Design System

Spacio uses a CSS custom property (variable) token system defined in `src/index.css`. All components reference these tokens for consistent theming across light and dark modes.

| Token | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--s-text` | Primary text colour |
| `--s-text-2` | Secondary/muted text |
| `--s-surface` | Card and panel backgrounds |
| `--s-surface-2` | Slightly elevated surface |
| `--s-accent` | Bronze highlight colour |
| `--s-border` | Subtle border colour |
| `--s-danger` | Red for destructive actions |
| `--f-serif` | Playfair Display (headings/logo) |
| `--f-sans` | Inter (body text/UI) |
| `--r-md` / `--r-lg` | Border radius tokens |

Dark mode is activated by toggling the `html.dark` class, swapping all token values automatically.
